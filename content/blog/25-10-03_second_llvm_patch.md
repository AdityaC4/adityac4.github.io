This post documents LLVM PR [#161302](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/161302), where I enabled `constexpr` evaluation for the x86 element extract/insert builtins that back Intel’s MMX, SSE, and AVX2 intrinsics. The work continues the [previous patch](@/blog/25-09-22_first_llvm_patch.md) and completes the basic SIMD element operations needed for compile-time table generation.

## Goals

- Bring parity between runtime and constexpr behavior for `__builtin_ia32_vec_ext_*` and `__builtin_ia32_vec_set_*`.
- Preserve architectural quirks such as index masking (`index & (NumElts - 1)`) so constexpr execution matches hardware results.
- Keep the AST evaluator and bytecode interpreter in sync, preventing divergence between the two constant-evaluation engines.

## Design and Implementation

The targeted builtins span 64-bit MMX vectors through 256-bit AVX2 vectors, covering signed/unsigned integers and floats. Each builtin follows the same pattern:

1. Normalize operands (vector value, element value, immediate index).
2. Mask the index to the vector width.
3. Either read or write the lane and return a new `APValue`.

Clang’s dual evaluator required two sets of changes:

- `ExprConstant.cpp`: teach `VectorExprEvaluator` to interpret the insert/extract builtins directly from the AST using `APValue` helpers.
- `InterpBuiltin.cpp`: add bytecode handlers that operate on the constexpr VM’s register model, with explicit type switching for integer and floating-point elements.

While prototyping I attempted to share logic via the `TYPE_SWITCH` macro, but the macro expands to pointer types that lack `toAPSInt()`. The final implementation keeps the float case separate and uses `INT_TYPE_SWITCH_NO_BOOL` for the integer matrix. I filed issue [#161685](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/161685) to track a cleaner abstraction.

## Testing

Support landed alongside updates to the existing x86 builtin tests:

- `clang/test/CodeGen/X86/mmx-builtins.c`
- `clang/test/CodeGen/X86/sse{2,41}-builtins.c`
- `clang/test/CodeGen/X86/avx2-builtins.c`

Each file now exercises the relevant extract/set intrinsics under `TEST_CONSTEXPR`, covering lane masking, type conversions, and boundary conditions. Example:

```c
TEST_CONSTEXPR(_mm_extract_epi16(vec16i, 5) == vec16i[5 & 0x3]);
TEST_CONSTEXPR(_mm256_insert_epi32(vec8i, value, 18) ==
               replace_lane(vec8i, value, 18 & 0x7));
```

The tests ensure both evaluators agree and that regressions are caught by the standard Clang test suite.

## Outcome

The patch resolves issue [#159753](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/159753) and unlocks constexpr usage for the remaining x86 element operations. Together with PR #158778, users can now construct and deconstruct SIMD data entirely at compile time, making it easier to build lookup tables and perform metaprogramming in header-only libraries.
